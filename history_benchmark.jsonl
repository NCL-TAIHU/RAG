{"question": "\n\n\nTranslation:\nThis study uses the historical records of Taiwan mentioned in 19th-century German geographical journals for a longitudinal analysis, with the aim of exploring how the \"German Empire\" as a latecomer, accumulated its knowledge of Taiwan in the process of gradually expanding its influence in Asia in the 19th century. Previous studies have mainly focused on the content of Western-language historical materials on Taiwan, or used Westerners' accounts to fill in the gaps in 19th-century Taiwanese history, or analyzed how Westerners' personal experiences and their immersion in the \"civilization and savagery\" of the time influenced their writing on Taiwan; in contrast, few have paid attention to the production process of these Western-language historical materials on Taiwan, namely how these materials were produced in the complex historical context of 19th-century European modernization, imperialism, and changes in East Asian regional dynamics. Therefore, this study takes \"German-language knowledge of Taiwan\" as an example, providing a rare perspective from a Western country on Taiwan, and by placing 19th-century German-language knowledge of Taiwan back in the historical context of European imperialism in Asia, German unification, and the rise of modern Japan in East Asia, it attempts to explain how these three factors promoted or hindered the German world's understanding of Taiwan, and to explore the special connotations of German-language knowledge of Taiwan formed in different historical contexts and how they reflect changes in German history, East Asian history, and world history. The study finds that before the occupation of Qingdao in 1897, the German Empire's influence in Asia was weaker than that of the UK, France, Russia, the US, and Japan, resulting in the presence of many non-German contributors to Taiwan knowledge in German academic journals, who had to rely on the contributions of British, French, American, and Japanese diplomats, scholars, merchants, and missionaries; the fluctuations in the number of these contributors were roughly tied to the emergence of Guangzhou free traders in the late 1820s, the Opium War in 1842, the arrival of the Black Ships in Japan in 1854, and the Meiji Restoration in Japan in the 1870s. The key turning point for the production of firsthand knowledge of Taiwan by Germans was the arrival of the Prussian Expeditionary Fleet in 1860, which concluded a series of treaties with the Qing Empire, Japan, and Siam; after this, there were occasional contributions to German academic journals from German sailors, scholars, and customs officers.

{"question": "\n\n\nTranslation:\nThe Chuan Feng Academy, located in Fuzhou, was selected as one of the 23 provincial academies in the 11th year of the Yongzheng era (1733). Not only did it produce famous scholars of the early Qing Dynasty, such as Cai Shiyuan, Lan Dingyuan, and Lei Feng, but it also had a profound impact on the development of the Taiwan East Sea Academy. This article describes the establishment and rooting of the Chuan Feng Academy, explaining the reasons for the revival of Fujian studies in the early Qing era. In 1707, during the 46th year of the Kangxi era, the governor Zhang Boring built the Chuan Feng Academy to promote Confucian studies. In addition to the name of the academy and its establishment, which showed that this place inherited the Fujian academic tradition, he also planned the daily reading schedule and published books that guided scholars to study Confucianism. He also sought the help of local families in the publication of the books. The development of the Chuan Feng Academy shows that the revival of Fujian studies was due to the effective assistance of local officials and the response to the academic concerns of local scholars. In the background of the Qing Dynasty, when the academic trend was gradually becoming a monolithic trend, this article presents the support of local scholars, local academic traditions, and the practical needs of the imperial examination, and jointly condenses the new face of Fujian academic circles. The revival of Confucian studies in Fujian was not only related to the national academic trend, but also the officials who promoted Confucian studies, who communicated with local scholars and families, and exchanged with local academic traditions, and arranged the relationship between Confucian studies and the imperial examination in a proper manner.\n\n\nThe question can be:\nWhat is the name of the academy that was built in Fuzhou to promote Confucian studies in 1707? \n\nAnswer: Chuan Feng Academy. \n\nNote: The question is designed to be answered by the document, and the answer can be found in the first paragraph of the document. \n\nAlternatively, you can also design a question that requires more in-depth understanding of the document, such as:\n\nWhat was the impact of the Chuan Feng Academy on the development of Taiwan East Sea Academy?\n\nAnswer: The Chuan Feng Academy had a profound impact on the development of Taiwan East Sea Academy.\n\nOr:\n\nWhat was the reason for the revival of Fujian studies in the early Qing", "answer_id": "505"}

With the simultaneous increase in economic and living standards, people have started to pay attention to the pursuit of food safety and energy reduction, and the food supply system has become a new social and cultural phenomenon. Therefore, the \"farmer's market\" was born in response to this trend, and its market space has effectively connected producers and consumers, forming a new social culture, and the market atmosphere has a nostalgic flavor of the past agricultural society, and has combined the green ecology and sustainable development trend.\n\nThis study aims to investigate the consumer's willingness to consume and loyalty to the farmer's market in Taipei's Beitou District, and to explore the association between the farmer's market consumer group and their willingness to consume. The research tool used is the survey method, and a total of 150 questionnaires were sent to consumers who have purchased products from the farmer's market, of which 112 were returned. The data was analyzed using SPSS to test the research hypotheses.\n\nThe research results show:\n\nOne: Consumers are willing to purchase products that have been inspected by a third-party certification body, and trust in the government's regulatory mechanism is also an important indicator of the producer's basic information.\n\nTwo: Consumer loyalty is established on the basis of purchasing and eating experiences, indicating that loyalty is built on the quality of the product itself.\n\nThree: The location and time of the farmer's market meet the needs of consumers, making it easy to purchase fresh products.\n\nFour: The relationship between consumer willingness and loyalty is mutually influential and has a positive effect.\n\nIn conclusion, the study hopes to find a way to improve people's understanding of the concept of \"food miles\" and the importance of environmental sustainability through consumers' willingness to consume and loyalty to farmer's market products, and to find a way to connect people with the land.\n\nKey words: Farmer's market, consumer willingness, loyalty, producers, consumers, environmental sustainability.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the main topic of this research study? \n\nA) The impact of climate change on agriculture\nB) The development of a new food supply system\nC) The consumer behavior and loyalty towards farmer's markets\nD) The effects of environmental sustainability on food production\n\nAnswer: C) The consumer behavior and loyalty towards farmer's markets. \n\nThis question", "answer_id": "1321"}

From the perspective of the governor-general's office, if the protection project is successful, it will help to reduce recidivism rates and the potential losses that come with it, thereby strengthening the power of governance. For the people, those who have made mistakes can return to society, and with reduced social crime rates, they can protect their personal property and assets, and both parties will benefit from this. As a result, the project has been deeply rooted in the local area and has been effectively developed and promoted.\n\nTaiwan's judicial protection project was mainly influenced by the modernization of Japanese colonial laws. After the Meiji Restoration, Japan established a protective system, which was the first step in understanding the development of Taiwan's protective projects. Although Taiwan's protective policies were deeply influenced by Japan, the Japanese laws and measures related to judicial protection were not uniformly applied to Taiwan. The judicial protection project in Taiwan began to take shape in the three-shed period, with each shed developing its own project, but they were interconnected and gradually formed a strong and powerful Taiwan Three-shed Association through mutual exchange and interaction.\n\nThe Taiwan Three-shed Association has been involved in regional protection projects and has expanded to cover the entire island, forming a complete judicial protection system. Although the project was initiated by Japanese people in Taiwan, some Taiwanese have begun to take an interest in it, and local activists, religious charities, and women's organizations have made contributions. Protection associations have emerged in various regions, and the project has continued to thrive.\n\nAs the Taiwan Three-shed Association has transferred some of its functions, such as coordination, direction, and guidance, to the above-mentioned coordinating bodies, such as the State Association of Protection and the Taiwan Association of Judicial Protection, the Taiwan Three-shed Association has gradually transitioned.\n\nThe drivers of the Taiwan Three-shed Association's business have had dual roles as employees and members of the association, which has ensured a certain continuity in the promotion of judicial protection projects. From the perspective of their educational background, the association's members have had a wide range of legal training, including some with police experience, judges, and prosecutors. The vast majority of members have had complete experience in prisons. Association members have a certain understanding of the situation in", "answer_id": "2"}

This article takes Hou Xiaoxian's film \"The Playdream Life\" as an example to explore the possibility of combining \"film\" and \"history\" and to analyze the director's historical consciousness. First, it compares the differences between Li Tianlu's memoirs and the film, and it analyzes the director's omissions and emphases to understand how Hou Xiaoxian, while making a biography of Li Tianlu, also provides the audience with a long-neglected history of colonial Taiwan and challenges the official narrative's stereotype of Japanese people. Second, it analyzes the forms and narrative strategies used in the film's production process to understand how Hou Xiaoxian consciously presents history and how he maintains a tone of \"realism,\" \"reason,\" and \"objectivity\" while emphasizing the film's fictional nature to prevent the audience from becoming immersed in the story and to achieve the goal of \"deconstructing\" official orthodox views. Finally, from the perspective of popular history, it reviews Hou Xiaoxian's creative process and themes and examines his collection, interpretation, and presentation of historical materials to find that \"The Playdream Life\" generally conforms to the principles of popular history writing, and Hou Xiaoxian can be considered a member of the popular history community.\n\nThe question that can be answered by the document is:\n\nWhat is the main theme or argument of the article about Hou Xiaoxian's film \"The Playdream Life\"? \n\n(Note: The question is designed to be answerable based on the content of the document, and the answer should be a concise summary of the main argument or theme of the article.) \n\nAnswer: The main theme or argument of the article is that Hou Xiaoxian's film \"The Playdream Life\" explores the possibility of combining \"film\" and \"history\" and challenges official narrative's stereotype of Japanese people by presenting a long-neglected history of colonial Taiwan. \n\nAlternatively, a more specific question that can be answered by the document is:\n\nWhat is the purpose of Hou Xiaoxian's film \"The Playdream Life\" according to the article? \n\nAnswer: The purpose of Hou Xiaoxian's film \"The Playdream Life\" is to provide the audience with a long-neglected history of colonial Taiwan and to challenge the official narrative's stereotype of Japanese people. \n\nOr another question that can", "answer_id": "4"}

{"question": "\u3001\u6e05\u5ef7\u7d71\u6cbb\u3002\nSummary\nFrom the perspective of spatial geography and the Qing dynasty, Taiwan's frontier in the 19th century was a double-edged border zone, which was the frontline of Qing power and the spatial boundary of distinction between civilized and savage tribes. It was also a forbidden area for Han people and a paradise for adventurers. With the continuous flow of people and goods, the frontier has been moving eastward and inland, showing a dynamic existence. In this field, Han people, civilized tribes, and savage tribes have complex relationships and intertwining events, while the Qing dynasty has tried to control the border society through isolation and separation policies.\n\nThis paper aims to present the appearance of Taiwan's border society in the early Qing dynasty through the study of the conflicts between Han and tribes, and the legal order of the society. These events have affected social order and have shaken the stability of the government, and to some extent, they reflect the nature of the Qing dynasty's rule and the control of local governance. This includes the policies of \"using tribes to control Han\" and \"using tribes to control tribes\". The Qing government has tried to control Han and tribes by using \"opposition, division, and intimidation\", and to block Han people from entering the frontier by relying on isolation, separation, and the fear of Han people of the savage tribes. However, the relationships between Han people, civilized tribes, and savage tribes in the border society have presented a multiplicity of forms, including opposition, cooperation, partnership, and assimilation, with both conflict and cooperation, and the production of various events such as murder, injury, and marriage networks. It is clear that the relationships between Han and tribes are not entirely in line with the Qing government's calculations.\n\nThe Qing government, which prioritizes national interests, has been unable to stop Han people from continuously flowing out of the border and cultivating new land, and has been unable to effectively control the savage tribes. The government's colonial-style rule over civilized tribes has also failed to fully integrate them into the administrative system, and the difficulties may be related to cultural differences, which may lead to the savage and civilized tribes' inability to negotiate with the Qing government's rule, and may be reflected in the continuous conflicts and \"tribal changes\" events. This cultural governance problem may not only be a problem for modern national governance, but also may exceed the control of the Qing dynasty's rule.\n\nKeywords: Qing dynasty Taiwan, frontier, savage tribes, civilized tribes, Han-tribal relationships, Qing government rule", "answer_id": "1057"}
{"question": "\n\n\nTranslation:\nSocial relationships in traditional Chinese society often involve reciprocity and a sense of retribution. These concepts are deeply ingrained in everyday life and are essential components of Chinese culture. However, in academic research, the concept of \"reporting\" (or \"retribution\") has been discussed extensively, but a deeper examination reveals that it has multiple layers and aspects across various disciplines, including social science, culture, psychology, and history. This paper aims to explore the concept of \"reporting\" in the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) through a socio-cultural perspective, using historical records and literature. The study focuses on the different types of behavior related to \"reporting\" and their cultural significance. The paper is divided into six chapters, covering the concept of \"reporting\", its psychological and behavioral aspects, its cultural significance, and its relationship with other concepts such as \"benevolence\" and \"revenge\".

{"question": "\n\n\nTranslation:\nMr. Qian Mu's book \"A General History of China\" published in 1940 was a comprehensive and influential Chinese history book in the early Republic of China. During his university teaching and writing of \"A General History of China,\" the idea that Chinese traditional politics was a despotic system had already become popular, and the materialist historiography of the left-wing trend had become widespread. The writing of \"A General History of China\" was, to some extent, a response to these contemporary opinions, which is explicitly stated in the preface of the book.\nIn \"A General History of China,\" the role of scholars in various historical stages is always in the core, and this view can be called \"Scholarly Politics.\" This study summarizes the historical explanations in the book in the fields of politics, society, and academia, analyzes the arguments, outlines the relationships, and explores the reasons, and compares the historical interpretations of contemporaries to highlight the characteristics of \"Scholarly Politics.\"\nThe main points of \"Scholarly Politics\" are as follows:\n\u4e00\u3001_A General History of China_ refers to the \"scholars\" who can recognize their responsibility to the affairs of the world and put their mission into practice. From the Qin and Han dynasties to the present, scholars have relied on their academic cultivation to organize the government, promote education, and improve people's lives in the capital, and to actively promote local public affairs in the countryside. Scholars have played a crucial role in Chinese history, and if scholars do not recognize their responsibilities or lack the necessary knowledge, then the development of various aspects of the country will be challenged.\n\u4e8c\u3001In politics, the formation of a peasant society from the Qin dynasty onwards is the main background for the establishment of a scholar-official government in the Han dynasty. Scholars actively promote political ideals, create a relatively rational political order, and educate society. However, scholars' resistance to dark regimes, scholars' conflicts with each other, scholars' neglect of their responsibilities to society, scholars' own decline, the monarch's private interests in controlling the regime, and the external regime's control of the world that hinders scholars' participation in politics, etc., have had a negative impact on political development at different times.\n\u4e09\u3001In society, scholars' long-term investment in local public affairs in the countryside has often influenced the rise and fall of local economies and cultures.

{"question": " \n\nTranslation:\nDuring the Qing dynasty, the board bridge known as \"\u678b\u6a4b\" in Taiwan was a relatively late-developed region in the process of land reclamation, but it has preserved many rich and intact historical sites.

This study found the following from these historical sites of temples, academies, and canals:\n\n1. The board bridge region became the domain of Minnan people because of the difficulty of developing the plain, and Lin Chengzu, a Minnan man, cooperated with the people of the Dasiang Society to open up the Dasiang Canal, which was a major canal that passed through the entire Dasiang Plain. The historical significance of the Dasiang Canal was that it promoted the conversion of the Dasiang Plain into a rice field and attracted more Minnan people to come and cultivate the land, gradually becoming the domain of the Minnan people.\n\n2. The two major Pingpu tribes, Wu Lan Bay and Dasiang, although their land was gradually taken over by Han people, they still tried to engage in farming and learn Han culture in order to preserve their tribe's life, but they were eventually subject to Hanization. Today, only some information about the tribe can be found in the local temple in the community.\n\n3. After the Lin Shuangwen incident, the Lin Chengzu family's development was gradually weakened, and the Lin Bensheng family, who was known for their strong commercial sense, took over the board bridge region after obtaining the water rights of the Dasiang Canal. The change of power between the two families also represented the transition of the board bridge region from an agricultural development group to a commercial development group. On the other hand, the strong style of the second generation of the Lin Bensheng family brought the board bridge region into the risk of conflict between the Minnan and Quan tribes, but from another angle, it also successfully resisted the invasion of the Quan tribe.\n\n4. Regardless of whether it was the Lin Chengzu family or the Lin Bensheng family, they both used religious organizations to establish their local leadership and, more specifically, the Lin Bensheng family used religious organizations to dissolve the old power and to promote unity among the Minnan people, to integrate the Ke tribe, and to seek reconciliation with the Quan tribe, which was a remarkable", "answer_id": "1201"}

The participants were divided into five age groups: 10-25, 26-40, 41-55, 56-70, and 71 and above. The results show that the most commonly used neutral interrogative sentence in Pingtung is the VP-mo sentence type, followed by VP-m-VP, He m he, VP-ja-m-VP, me, Kam-VP, will m will, and question sentence. The study found that: (1) Regardless of age, gender, or region, the most commonly used neutral interrogative sentence is the VP-mo sentence type, showing that this sentence type is the mainstream in the Hakka language in Pingtung. (2) The VP-ja m-VP sentence type is most commonly used by the elderly (71 and above), and other age groups use it less, suggesting that this sentence type will be gradually lost over time. (3) The Kam-VP sentence type is used by younger people (55 and below), and older people (56 and above) use it less, indicating that this sentence type is becoming younger.

{"question": "\n\n\nTranslation:\nA national currency, usually referring to a country's unified official currency, due to Taiwan's special historical background, after being under the administration of the Republic of China in 1945, Taiwan did not use the same currency as the mainland. In 1946 and 1949, the two currency reforms were implemented due to the war, and the local special currency system was adopted. After the Republic of China government moved to Taiwan, the New Taiwan Dollar currency was stabilized, and it has been continuously used to this day. However, currency has economic value beyond its use, and through the circulation of currency, it can demonstrate the exercise of sovereignty within the country and represent the country's economic power to the outside world. Like a national flag, a country's currency has extremely high symbolic significance, implying a sense of national identity. In the initial period of the Republic of China government's move to Taiwan, when there was an urgent need to maintain the legitimacy of the government, the question of whether to re-establish the national currency or to change the national currency to the New Taiwan Dollar arose. This controversy expanded with the re-establishment of the Central Bank, as the Constitution stipulates that the currency system shall be administered by the central authority, and the Central Bank's re-establishment may lead to currency reform, making the New Taiwan Dollar and the national currency a contentious issue. Furthermore, according to the \"Regulations for the Issue of Silver Dollars and Silver Dollar Exchange Coupons\" established in 1949, the national currency of the Republic of China is based on the silver dollar, but after the silver dollar lost its value and was no longer used, the national currency was still based on the silver dollar, resulting in a dual-track currency system with the New Taiwan Dollar and the silver dollar. The fixed exchange rate between the New Taiwan Dollar and the silver dollar has caused confusion among the public, and the resulting fine amounts are too low to deter crime, so the Legislative Yuan has often proposed that the New Taiwan Dollar be upgraded to the national currency to resolve the currency unification issue. Although the New Taiwan Dollar is not a national currency, it will not affect its circulation, legal enforceability, or applicability, and its value has not fluctuated significantly, but from a legal perspective, it is crucial. Moreover, the controversy over the New Taiwan Dollar's status has a significant political connotation, and through the discussion of the New Taiwan Dollar's status, one can understand the changes in the political atmosphere over the past 50 years.

{"question": "\n\n\n\u7ffb\u8b6f\uff1a\nThe purpose of the 1959 Lu Mountain Conference was to summarize and criticize the errors made since Mao Zedong launched the Great Leap Forward and established people's communes. However, due to Mao's optimistic assessment of the situation and his determination to defend the Three Red Banners, the criticism was not thorough enough. During the conference, Peng Dehuai repeatedly spoke out and wrote to Mao, bluntly pointing out the numerous problems caused by the Great Leap Forward and people's communes, which aroused Mao's anger and led him to launch a counterattack, elevating the criticism to a struggle over lines and classes. This ultimately led to the downfall of Peng Dehuai, Huang Kecheng, Zhang Wen Tian, and Zhou Xiaozhou, who were labeled as a \"counter-revolutionary clique\", and the conference was transformed from a criticism of errors to a campaign against rightists, resulting in a tragic outcome.\n\nThe reasons for the reversal of the Lu Mountain Conference are extremely complex. Internationally, the Sino-Soviet split, Mao's dissatisfaction with Khrushchev, and foreign criticism of the Great Leap Forward and people's communes all contributed to Mao's incorrect connection of Peng Dehuai with Khrushchev. Domestically, there were differences in opinion on the situation and ideology between Mao and Peng Dehuai, Mao's suspicion of Peng Dehuai's motives for writing letters, Mao's past grudges against Peng Dehuai, and the strengthening of Mao's personal cult and the promotion of pro-Mao forces.\n\nAfter the Lu Mountain Conference, the anti-rightist struggle expanded and intensified, leading to the \"Three Years of Difficulty\" famine, and in the context of strengthening Mao's personal cult, indirectly led to the Cultural Revolution, causing severe disasters and impacts on China.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat was the original purpose of the 1959 Lu Mountain Conference?

{"question": "\n\n\nTranslation:\nThe Tang Code has a profound impact on Chinese legal history. Since the establishment of the Tang Code, it has served as a model for the laws of later dynasties. The influence of the Tang Code can be seen in the fact that it was used as a reference point for the laws of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. The promulgation of the \"Tang Code Commentary\" symbolized the maturity of traditional China's legal system, and it had a profound impact on the laws of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties.\n\nIn discussing household order, one must consider the concept of li (etiquette) and its influence on the behavior of individuals in society. In a family, individuals' status and obligations are regulated by li. Therefore, studying the criminal problems between relatives is helpful in understanding the development of the concept of li in the legal system and the operation of household order. Additionally, the concept of \"relatives committing crimes\" refers to the special status of individuals who have a familial relationship with the perpetrator or victim. To resolve such crimes, one must consider the familial relationships, status, and age of the individuals involved, as well as the construction, recognition, and sentencing of the crimes.\n\nThis paper will focus on the discussion of the \"Tang Code: Name Example Law,\" \"Tang Code: Thief and Robbery Law,\" and \"Tang Code: Dispute Law.\" The reason for choosing these three chapters is that they contain the most relevant regulations regarding \"relatives committing crimes.\"\n\nThis paper is divided into six chapters.

Behind the slaughter, there was Chen Yi's administration's meticulous plan to handle the 228 Incident, as well as complex political operations. The core strategy of the operation was to manufacture and expand misunderstandings, in addition to exaggerating the violent acts of the people of the province and the disaster of the people from other provinces, to also insert the two main enemies of the National Army, the Japanese and the Communists, into the anti-government crowds of Taiwan (officially referred to as \"traitors\"), and to ignite the flames of Chinese nationalism, and to retaliate against the Japanese people by transferring the hatred of the National Army to the people of Taiwan. Therefore, the National Army's methods of slaughter in the 228 Incident can be seen everywhere as a imitation of the brutal methods of the Japanese military. The cruelty of the Japanese military's brutality, the viciousness of Chinese politics, and the tragedy of Taiwan's fate, are all closely tied and form an important and hidden context of the 228 Incident.\n\nThis level of tragedy in the 228 Incident directly affected the breadth of the escape. In order to escape the slaughter, thousands of people embarked on the escape, from hiding in plains to fleeing to mountains, from islands to other islands. Graves, toilets, and the ceilings of houses all had people hiding in them. The authorities, in order to capture the escapees, used measures such as offering rewards, arresting people, encouraging surrender, and household registration checks. Compared to the authorities, the escapees had very limited options. However, due to the foreign authorities' unfamiliarity with Taiwan, many escaped and were not caught. In addition to the \"visible\" escape, there was also an \"invisible\" but far-reaching \"spiritual escape\": under the shadows of the mass slaughter and the white terror, Taiwanese people of two to three generations were voluntarily or forcibly silenced, and escaped from remembering, contacting, and discussing the 228 Incident. This kind of silence still affects the Taiwanese society today.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat was the main strategy of the National Army's operation in the 228 Incident?

{"question": "\n\n\nTranslation:\nAfter the 19th century, the Hebei region was affected by the Qing dynasty's \"enclosure policy\" and later by the rapid growth of population, which far exceeded the growth of land, leading to a tight relationship between people and land resources, forcing local industries to change, and also stimulating the living difficulties of the people to seek opportunities outside. Even before the \"Kanto Closure\" period, there were large numbers of people \"violating\" the ban and migrating to the Kanto region to make a living. After the Kanto Closure was officially lifted in 1860, males from the Hebei region went to the Northeast to work, mostly temporarily or seasonally, and left their wives and children in their hometowns to be taken care of by their husbands' families or their own families.\n\nThis article uses statistical analysis of historical documents such as \"Shuntian Prefecture Archives\" and local gazetteers to find that the change in family life led to a situation where women were forced to accept remarriage or work outside the home, especially in cases where the woman's family was poor and unable to support her and her children. Many women were also sold or hired out without their knowledge.\n\nWhen facing these numerous cases of \"women's sale,\" officials how did they handle them and how did they achieve some punishment effect? It turned out that the county officials' decisions were mainly divided into the following categories: one, returning the case to the local clans, neighbors, or community for mediation; two, the county officials would weigh the \"reasons\" and the national law, and make a \"fair\" decision. Compared to the county officials' judgments, the central officials' judgments in dealing with cases related to the sale of women were often different. However, regardless of the severity of the cases, in the cases presented to the central authorities for review, officials were able to accurately apply the provisions of the Qing Code to each case, making sure that the perpetrators were punished according to the law.\n\nThe question that can be answered by the document is:\n\nWhat was the typical way for county officials to handle cases of women being sold or hired out without their knowledge? \n\nThe answer can be found in the document, which states: \"\u4e00\u3001\u4ea4\u4ed8\u5730\u65b9\u5b97\u65cf\uff08\u5bb6\u65cf\uff09\u3001\u9130\u91cc\u3001\u9109\u4fdd\u7b49\u9032\u884c\u8abf\u89e3\" which translates to: \"one, returning the case to the local clans, neighbors, or community for mediation\". \n\nNote: The question is a specific one that can be answered by the document", "answer_id": "937"}

This period had a profound impact on individuals, including their choices and decisions. The document tells the story of a Ming loyalist, Kuang-y\u00fcan (1599-1676), who was a prominent figure in the transition period. Kuang-y\u00fcan was a high-ranking official in the Ming dynasty, but he was eventually imprisoned and flogged for his opposition to the corrupt official, Chou Y\u00fcn-ch\u00fc. After the fall of the Ming dynasty, Kuang-y\u00fcan fled to the mountains and became a Buddhist monk. He later returned to society and became the abbot of a temple, where he was involved in a controversy over the role of Buddhist monks in the Qing dynasty.

{"question": " The document discusses the Nationalist Party's (KMT) organization and control of civilian society during the martial law era, focusing on the integration of folk society through various means, including the \"Five Arts\" (or \"Wu Shu\"). The Five Arts are a set of practices that date back to ancient times and are believed to possess supernatural powers, but have been subject to religious exploitation and government suppression throughout history. In modern times, the Five Arts face challenges from science and political concerns due to their deep-rooted presence in civilian society. This study examines the KMT's integration of Five Arts groups during the martial law era, exploring the difficulties and limitations encountered in the process.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat are the five arts that the document mentions? \n\nThe best answer is:\nWu Shu. \nNote: Wu Shu is a Chinese term that refers to a set of practices or arts that include martial arts, spiritual practices, and other forms of self-cultivation. In the context of the document, Wu Shu is used to refer to a specific set of practices or arts that are being studied. \n\nIt is worth noting that the document does not provide a detailed explanation of what Wu Shu specifically refers to, and it is likely that the term is being used in a more general sense to refer to a set of practices or arts that are being studied. Therefore, the answer \"Wu Shu\" is a reasonable inference based on the context of the document. \n\nIt is also worth noting that the term \"Five Arts\" is used in the document, but it is likely that the author is referring to Wu Shu as a specific example of the Five Arts, rather than providing a detailed explanation of the Five Arts in general. \n\nIn any case, the question is asking what the five arts are, and the answer \"Wu Shu\" is a reasonable inference based on the context of the document. \n\nIt is also worth noting that the document does not provide a detailed explanation of what Wu Shu specifically refers to, and it is likely that the term is being used in a more general sense to refer to a set of practices or arts that are being studied.

{"question": "\n\n\nTranslation:\nThis study aims to reconstruct the process of the Battle of Fire Burn (1895), the last anti-Japanese war in Taiwan, which was fought by the Hakka people of the Six Heaps in southern Taiwan. The battle was sparked by the defeat of the Qing Empire in the First Sino-Japanese War and the signing of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which led to the Japanese government's attempts to take control of Taiwan. The battle took place in the village of Fire Burn in Longxu Township, Pingtung County, Taiwan, which was the center of the Six Heaps. To this day, the people of Longxu Township still commemorate and honor this historical event in various ways, such as through drama performances, cultural festivals, and the establishment of a memorial park. In 2017, the local residents requested the support of the Council for Hakka Affairs to convert the memorial park into a museum. In 2019, the Pingtung County Government passed the \"Longxu Township Fire Burn Village Memorial Day Autonomy Ordinance\", which is a groundbreaking move in Taiwan. This shows the efforts of the local people to promote the history of the Battle of Fire Burn and the spirit of bravery of the heroes. However, all forms of commemorative activities and historical exhibitions must be based on thorough historical research. The Japanese military left behind a report on the battle, which is called the \"South Expedition Branch Battle Report\", which includes a detailed map of the battlefield and the surrounding terrain. This study uses this document as the core and uses GIS technology to create a series of maps of the battle, which presents the war process in a spatial way. Through the interpretation of this historical document and the use of digital humanities tools, we can reconstruct the process of the battle and give it a rational geographic space. At the same time, we can examine the armed strength of the Hakka people of the Six Heaps. This study believes that the Battle of Fire Burn was a defensive war by the Hakka people of the Six Heaps, who ultimately could not withstand the Japanese army. However, the Hakka people showed their flexibility in combat, their use of firearms, and their multiple defensive structures, which shocked the Japanese army. This study also shows that the combat conditions of the people of Fire Burn Village were a strategy formed through their long-term adaptation to a competitive environment since the Qing dynasty's Kangxi period.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat was the main objective of the study that reconstructed the process of the Battle of Fire Burn in", "answer_id": "1840"}

However, the number of soldiers who have completed their service and returned to civilian life has exceeded 33,000 by 2020. As the soldiers approach the end of their service and enter the job market, the demand for guidance will undoubtedly increase. This study aims to explore the differences in original family capital between soldiers who have completed their service and to analyze the impact of military experience on the flow of soldiers. The study aims to provide references for the employment guidance and skill development strategies for soldiers who have completed their service. The study found that only economic capital in family capital showed significant differences in some background variables. The economic capital of soldiers from the southern region of Taiwan was significantly lower than that of soldiers from northern Taiwan. Soldiers with a university degree had a significantly higher economic capital than those with a vocational degree. Age, years of service, and military rank were related variables. Soldiers who were older, had more years of service, and had a higher military rank were more likely to participate in vocational training, but they had a lower proportion of full-time employment, a lower occupation prestige, lower income, and higher dissatisfaction with their current economic situation. Soldiers who were younger, had fewer years of service, and had a lower military rank had a lower proportion of vocational training participation, but they had a higher occupation prestige, higher satisfaction with their current economic situation, and lower dissatisfaction with their current economic situation. Education level had no significant impact on the flow of soldiers (except for vocational training participation). Military experience had a significant impact on the flow of soldiers, with soldiers who had experienced military life having a higher occupation prestige, full-time employment, job satisfaction, income, and satisfaction with their current economic situation.\n\nThe question that can be answered by the document is:\n\nWhat is the expected increase in the demand for employment guidance for soldiers who have completed their service?

The research methods used include historical literature analysis, oral history research methods, and HGIS research methods. The literature collected includes historical books, household registers, old photos, and newspapers from the Japanese colonial period, which are then analyzed and integrated. Oral history research methods involve collecting memories from elderly people, residents, village officials, and church leaders in the Maowan Village of the different tribes, which can accurately restore the appearance of early life. The HGIS research method uses geographic information systems to present the changes in the research area through visual maps, which can clearly understand the distribution of tribes, hunting paths, etc. in the Maowan Village, and the relationship between the Dan people and other ethnic groups in terms of land use.\n\nThe purpose of this study is not only to conduct a community history research project, but also to emphasize the history and culture of the indigenous people and their autonomy.

{"question": " \n\nTranslation:\nIn the mid-1950s, the Taiwan Provincial Government, originally located in Taipei, was relocated to central Taiwan. Subsequently, the provincial government built the five major provincial government dormitory groups, including the Guangfu New Village, Zhongxing New Village, Chang'an New Village, Audit New Village, and L\u01d0m\u00edng New Village. The five major provincial government dormitory groups are indispensable to the historical memory of post-war Taiwan. Therefore, this article focuses on the relocation of the Taiwan Provincial Government, the planning and construction of the provincial government dormitory groups, and builds the background and development context of the implementation of the relocation policy and the implementation of the policy of reunification. In addition to presenting the design blueprints, construction contents, and present differences of each dormitory group, the article also presents the background and development context of the implementation of the relocation policy and the implementation of the policy of reunification.\n\nThe Taiwan Provincial Government was relocated to central Taiwan due to the impact of the post-war government of the Republic of China. After withdrawing to Taiwan, besides causing a shortage of office space for the Executive Yuan, the unstable situation across the strait led to the implementation of a series of air-raid evacuation policies by the provincial government. The outbreak of the Korean War and the signing of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty, as well as the continuous occurrence of cross-strait conflicts, not only made the possibility of the Republic of China's government attacking the mainland gradually decrease, but also caused the provincial government to change the \"evacuation\" outside of Xizhi to \"relocation\" in central Taiwan. At the same time, after the war, Taiwan attached great importance to talent cultivation and technology introduction under US aid, and the director of the Evacuation Engineering Department, Liu Yonghao, obtained a United Nations scholarship to study in the UK, and learned about the concept of new towns. \n\nAfter completing his investigation, Liu Yonghao applied the concepts he had learned to the planning of the Guangfu New Village, Zhongxing New Village in the late 1950s, and the L\u01d0m\u00edng New Village in the 1970s, all of which took into account the convenience and accessibility of community residents' lives, and not only approximated the planning ideas of British garden cities and first-generation new towns, but also fully demonstrated the community's overall self-sufficiency and accessibility, making them functional communities that combined residential and living functions.

In 1883, the Qing government established the Navy Ministry, which was the first naval department in Chinese history. The Navy Ministry was responsible for coordinating sea defense matters, which were previously handled by local authorities. The establishment of the Navy Ministry marked a significant turning point in China's modern naval development. The Navy Ministry was responsible for managing the North Sea Fleet, which was the main naval force of the Qing government. However, the fleet faced significant challenges, including funding issues and inadequate training. The Navy Ministry's budget was limited, and the fleet was unable to purchase new ships or install modern artillery. As a result, the fleet's combat effectiveness declined, and it suffered a series of defeats, including the Battle of the Yellow Sea in 1894 and the Battle of Weihaiwei in 1895.

Reading has become a priority in education. Two Elementary Schools in Taipei transformed their libraries into reading corners to create a good reading environment, encouraging students to read anywhere, anytime, and to improve the school's reading atmosphere.\nThis study aims to understand the environmental awareness and behavior intentions of high school students in the school reading space environment of New Taipei City's Zhongzheng Elementary School, and to explore the differences in environmental awareness and behavior intentions among students with different attributes. The study analyzed the relationship between environmental awareness and behavior intentions.\nThe research method of this study is to use the Zhongzheng Elementary School as the research scope, high school students as the research subjects, and the survey method as the research tool. Using SPSS to describe and analyze the data, the study explored the relationship between students' environmental awareness and behavior intentions towards the school's reading space environment, and aimed to provide suggestions for improving the school environment.\nThe research results showed that students have a high level of environmental awareness and a positive attitude towards the school's reading space environment. The analysis of student behavior intentions showed that the values were all above 3, indicating a positive intention. The analysis results showed that there was a positive correlation between students' environmental awareness and behavior intentions. The results showed that when students had high environmental awareness, their behavior intentions were also high.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the primary goal of the Ministry of Education's reading program in Taiwan?

{"question": "\n\n\nTranslation:\nSongs have always been a mirror of society, reflecting and influencing each other, and sharing the same cultural values with humans. After the economic and social stability, people will have more leisure time and money to invest in music. With the economic development and political relaxation in Taiwan, the government no longer restricts people's pursuit of entertainment, and people can enjoy creative activities freely.\n\nThe era of \"Taiwanese money flooding the streets\" is a glittering age that has come after a long period of hard work and accumulation. From the massive American aid to Taiwan, Taiwan has gradually changed its economic policies and experienced different periods of policy changes. The improvement of people's economic status has led to an increase in living standards, making it easier for people to appreciate music; the relaxation of politics has also allowed record companies and creators to produce more songs. However, the urbanization phenomenon brought about by economic prosperity has also led to a sense of nostalgia for hometowns and past things, giving rise to the popularization of critical songs.\n\nIn the Taiwanese Mandarin pop music scene, the campus folk song era emerged in 1975, when Taiwan people began to think about their cultural identity in the face of international changes. The era of campus folk songs was characterized by the emergence of \"singing our own songs\" movement. In 1982, Lu Hsun-yu's album \"Zhihuo\" was released, and in 1983, Su Ru's album \"Su Ru Special Edition\" was released, both of which used rock music and realistic criticism of the political situation and described social phenomena, introducing new ways of interpreting songs. This album was praised by music critics as a formal farewell to the previous criticism of campus songs as \"weak, pale, and whining\", and marked a new turning point in the Taiwanese pop music scene. With the relaxation of restrictions on songs, the creation and release of songs became more diverse, and the accumulated musical energy influenced neighboring area singers to develop in Taiwan, making Taiwan's music more diverse.\n\nThis article focuses on the period from 1975 to 2000, with 2000 marking the end of a generation. The differences in common memories, social values, and song styles have created different songs and contemporary memories. The connection between music and social phenomena is extremely high. By combining digital humanities and HGIS, the analysis of Chinese songs during that period can be constructed, and compared with the social atmosphere and environment of that time, a deeper understanding of the music atmosphere can be gained.

After the fall of the Qing dynasty, Chen Biyuan assassinated Wang Jingwei, who was still alive, and became a hero of the Republic of China, and Chen Biyuan was also one of the founders of the Republic of China. They got married and were widely admired and blessed. Later, they went to France to study, but due to the dramatic changes in the domestic political situation, Wang Jingwei returned to China at the request of Sun Yat-sen and entered the political arena. Chen Biyuan also had her own political energy, and during the establishment of the Yellow Sea Military Academy, she raised funds for overseas Chinese and became one of the three female representatives of the Nationalist Party at the first National Representative Conference, and was elected as a Central Committee member and a Central Supervisory Committee member, a position she held until she left the Nationalist Government in Chongqing with Wang. However, Chen Biyuan was mostly following Wang Jingwei's choices and political ups and downs, and sometimes active and sometimes abroad. She was often by Wang's side and sometimes acted as his deputy or executor. When Wang was in Europe for treatment, Chen stayed in China to monitor the situation and contact the members of the Wang faction; after Wang left the Nationalist Government in Chongqing, Chen played the role of conveying Wang's intentions and maintaining the unity of the faction. Chen Biyuan was an important pillar in Wang's political career, sometimes behind the scenes and sometimes in the spotlight. As China's politics underwent turmoil and changes, Chen and Wang's political fortunes rose and fell, and after the eight-year war, Wang died, but was later declared to be the first great traitor. Chen Biyuan was also put on trial as a traitor and was declared to be the \"first female traitor\".

{"question": "\n\n\nTranslation:\nTraditional China attaches great importance to \"giving birth\" in marriage, and the main purpose of marriage is to propagate descendants and pass on the family name. In order to ensure the permanent continuation of the family, for women, it is a natural duty to give birth to male offspring for her husband and the family. Therefore, the idea of \"there are three kinds of unfilial conduct, and the lack of posterity is the greatest\" and \"the more children, the more grandchildren, the more blessings\" is deeply rooted in people's minds, and has a profound impact on the reproductive culture of ordinary people. The \"Wanbao Quanshu\" widely used in the Ming and Qing dynasties is a popular book in the community, with rich and varied content, and is equivalent to a modern encyclopedia. The book collects and records the daily life knowledge and skills that people are concerned about and will use in their daily lives. This study takes two versions, \"Wuchan Bajian\" and \"Santai Wanyong Zhengzong\", as the main materials, analyzes the content related to reproduction, and explores the reproductive culture of ordinary people during the Ming and Qing dynasties, including the preparation and precautions for conception, pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care for women and newborn babies.

The text uses a combination of literary analysis and Geographic Information System (GIS) to explore the society's transformation. During the Dutch colonial period, the Thung-hsiang Society remained isolated from the outside world, but the arrival of Han Chinese settlers in the Qing dynasty period led to changes in the society's economy and culture. The Han Chinese settlers gradually moved into the area and established settlements along the Thung-hsiang River, leading to the loss of land and the decline of the Thung-hsiang Society's traditional way of life. By the mid-Qing dynasty period, the Thung-hsiang Society was facing economic difficulties and some members had left the area to seek a better life. During the Qing dynasty, the Han Chinese settlers continued to move into the area, leading to the formation of a new society with a different culture and economy. By the end of the Qing dynasty, the Thung-hsiang Society had been largely assimilated into the Han Chinese society, and its traditional way of life had been lost. The text concludes that the Thung-hsiang Society's transformation is a complex example of cultural assimilation and the impact of external forces on a society's development.\n\nThe question that can be answered by the document is:\n\nWhat was the impact of the arrival of Han Chinese settlers on the Thung-hsiang Society's economy and culture?

From the perspective of the succession of central fisheries policies, the fisheries development in such a small coastal village like Dongshi is greatly affected by fisheries policies, and the development of fisheries also affects the existence and change of fish markets and the way of fish production and marketing. Through the example of Dongshi fish market, local small fish markets have developed different sales methods to adapt to the environment of declining fisheries, but Dongshi fish market not only changes the production and marketing environment, but also establishes a connection between the fish market and the local community, providing a space for emotional communication for local people.

They were entrusted with the responsibility of managing Buddhist affairs, and many of them were Buddhist believers themselves. However, despite their influence and power, they were unable to prevent the destruction of Buddhism, which was driven by the personal will of Emperor Wu Zong. In fact, the eunuchs continued to exert influence over the Buddhist community, even during the destruction of Buddhism, and played a significant role in the allocation of Buddhist resources.

{"question": "\n\n\nTranslation:\nIn the 1930s, China's rural areas faced economic bankruptcy, social disorder, political turmoil, and foreign invasion, so land reform became the focus of discussion, with actions aimed at saving, reviving, rebuilding, and transforming rural areas. As various regions implemented their own measures to rescue rural areas, Yan Xishan submitted a \"Outline and Explanation of the Village Public Ownership of Land System\" to the National Government in September 1935. The outline consisted of 13 articles, including the issuance of interest-free public bonds by the village public office, the purchase of all village land by the village, and the distribution of \"portion land\" to farmers based on the quality of the land and the amount of land each person could cultivate. The \"Land Village Public Ownership System\" reflects the urgent need to rescue rural areas in the 1930s, as well as the political situation in Shanxi, where Yan Xishan was in power, amidst the struggles of local power brokers, the expansion of the Communist Party, and foreign invasions. In terms of economic thought, the system not only inherited Sun Yat-sen's populism but was also influenced by traditional and Western thought, such as the distribution of \"portion land\" to ensure that each farmer had a sufficient area to cultivate, a concept that dates back to ancient China's \"\u4e95\u7530\" (a system of dividing land into square fields), Dong Zhongshu's \"\u9650\u7530\" (a system of limiting the amount of land a farmer could cultivate), and the \"\u5747\u7530\" (a system of equal land distribution) of the Northern Wei Dynasty. The purchase of land was modeled after the Romanian method of issuing public bonds. In short, the \"Land Village Public Ownership System\" was a product of Chinese-Western cultural exchange, with both defensive and economic goals, although it was not ultimately implemented, Yan Xishan's proposal provided a possible solution to China's land problem, which resonated with society in the 1930s and had its own unique significance and ideology.\n\nQuestion: \nWhat was the name of the plan that Yan Xishan submitted to the National Government in September 1935, aiming to reform land ownership in rural areas? \n\nPlease choose a suitable answer from the following options:\n\nA) \u4e95\u7530\nB) \u9650\u7530\nC) \u5747\u7530\nD) \u300a\u571f\u5730\u6751\u516c\u6709\u8fa6\u6cd5\u5927\u7db1\u53ca\u8aaa\u660e\u300b\n\nPlease select the best answer from the options provided. \n\nNote: The", "answer_id": "1247"}

Was it called Taiwan Province Taipei High School?  No, it was called Taiwan Province Taipei High School's predecessor, Taipei High School, which was later renamed to Taipei High School.  But before that, the school was known as Taiwan Governor-General Taipei High School.  So the answer is: Taiwan Governor-General Taipei High School.  This school was established in 1922.  It was a unique school that had a different curriculum, faculty, and autonomous school spirit compared to other high schools in Taiwan during the Japanese colonial period.  The students of this school could enter the Imperial University of Japan without taking any entrance exams, which was a privilege that not many students had.  This school was able to produce many leaders in various fields in Taiwan and Japan.  In 1945, after Japan's defeat in World War II, the school was renamed to Taipei High School and continued to operate until it was abolished in 1949.  The school's campus and assets were handed over to the Taiwan Provincial Teachers' College.  The school's legacy lived on, and it was later renamed to Taipei Senior High School.  The school's history is a reflection of the complex and tumultuous times in which it operated.

{"question": "\n\n\nTranslation:\nThe Tiger-riding Crane and Tiger-and-Crane Drum are special funerary objects found in Chu tombs. This article mainly studies the 21 pieces of Tiger-riding Crane and 44 pieces of Tiger-and-Crane Drum, comparing their excavation sites, tomb dates, and their relationship with other related objects, and further explores and analyzes the origins of the Crane, Tiger, and Deer in Chu culture, and why the Chu people combined these three different animals.\n\nThe Tiger-riding Crane and Tiger-and-Crane Drum were excavated in the Jianghan, Hanchuan, Changsha, and Lintong areas of the Gangu and Qincheng hills. Depending on the excavation site, the artistic style of these two objects will also be different. The Tiger-riding Crane and Tiger-and-Crane Drum first appeared in the early Warring States period, flourished in the middle Warring States period, and declined in the late Warring States period.\n\nThe Tiger-riding Crane and Tiger-and-Crane Drum reflect the long-term cultural exchange and combination of the local culture in the middle Yangtze River Valley and external cultures. The Shijiahe culture-Chu culture line of civilization worshipped the Phoenix, while in the Warring States period, the Chu culture worshipped the Crane as the main image of the Phoenix. The tiger worship may have originated from the hunting culture of the surrounding areas of Chu, and also influenced the Ba culture, and with the increasing close exchange between Chu and Ba, tiger worship was introduced into Chu culture. Deer worship originated from the grassland regions, transmitted from the northwest's horse trade routes.\n\nThe Chu people chose to combine the Crane, Tiger, and Deer to create these funerary objects because water is an important medium in the traditional ascension beliefs of the middle Yangtze River Valley, and these three animals are all aquatic animals, so they combined these three animals. This set of funerary objects also reflects the Chu people's ascension beliefs, meaning that the Tiger is the guardian of the sky, the Tiger's mouth is also the entrance to heaven, the Crane is the guide to ascension and the protector of the deceased and their ancestors, and the Deer's antlers represent the worship of ancestors and rebirth, used to enhance the power of the Tiger-riding Crane.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat was the main reason why the Chu people chose to combine the Crane, Tiger, and Deer to create these funerary objects? \nA) Because the three animals are all land", "answer_id": "1816"}

How do we, who live on this land, view and recognize them? The shaping and promotion of Taiwan's ornithological knowledge system from 1945 to the late 1980s is the topic of this article. In the early years after World War II, due to war destruction and insufficient research resources, Taiwan's ornithological research was temporarily stagnant, but a few scholars still conducted literature reviews. In the mid-1960s, the US military research institution began to promote transnational migration disease research plans in East Asia. The seasonal migration of birds was seen as a way to monitor the spread of viruses, and Taiwan was invited to join the transnational plan. The research team in Taiwan, led by the Department of Biology at East China University, was the first time since the war that Taiwan had participated in cross-border bird research, and it also drove the development of bird watching activities. In 1973, the Taiwan Birdwatchers' Club (Taiwan Birdwatcher's Club R.O.C.) was founded, which is the precursor to today's Taipei City Birdwatching Association. The early bird watching activities were limited by inadequate equipment and the closed political environment, and most people did not understand the value of observing birds. The development was not smooth. In the 1980s, with the rise of tourism and media promotion, bird watching activities gradually became known to the public. The hunting and export of wild birds and their specimens received attention from various parties. The calls of civil society groups led to government enforcement and regulatory adjustments. The organization of bird clubs played an important role in supervising and communicating the preservation of wild habitats. It can be seen that the core value of bird clubs has gradually shifted from their initial recreational nature to research, education, and conservation promotion.

In Taiwan, you can see in schools that there are educational imperial rescripts, imperial portraits, and facilities or spaces dedicated to the Emperor's sanctity. Imperial portraits are portraits of the Emperor and Empress, educational imperial rescripts are statements made by the Cabinet on behalf of the Emperor on education, and facilities or spaces dedicated to the Emperor's sanctity are specialized facilities or spaces for protecting items related to the Emperor. Further comparison of the literary data shows that the donation status of the rescripts in Taiwan's schools is not as described in the \"Taiwan Education History\" as all schools in Taiwan having them, but rather depending on whether there are facilities or spaces dedicated to the Emperor's sanctity. In addition, a review of the facilities or spaces dedicated to the Emperor's sanctity reveals that the shape and appearance of the facilities or spaces are meaningful, and that the protection of the items is different depending on the item. The donation and dedication of the rescripts are still dependent on the ability of each school, and the schools will try to prepare facilities or spaces dedicated to the Emperor's sanctity through donations, fundraising, and other means. Through the analysis of the donation, dedication, daily arrangement, and rituals of specific holidays, as well as the facilities or spaces dedicated to the Emperor's sanctity, it can be known that at the time, there were strong efforts to construct the sanctity of the Emperor and shape the identification.

Facing the Philippines on the other side of the Pacific, the Spanish Bourbon dynasty continued to follow the Habsburg dynasty's methods, implementing the Laws of the Indies to govern this colony. As the situation in the East Asian waters changed and maritime technology improved, the Spanish tried to take advantage of the Philippines' geographical location to obtain trading opportunities with the Chinese and let the Galleon ships sailing on the Acapulco-Manila line carry more Asian goods. However, the Galleon ships laden with rich Oriental treasures began to be coveted by British privateers, and in the mid-18th century, the British even plotted to attack and occupy Manila, making various acts of infringement on the Spanish colonial government's authority. This led the Spanish Bourbon dynasty to consider reforming their colonial policy in the Philippines.\n\nIn 1785, the Spanish established the Royal Philippine Company in Madrid, a chartered trading company aimed at promoting economic development and export trade in the Philippines. This company strengthened the Philippines' importance in Asian trade and opened up direct trade between Spain and the Philippines. The Royal Philippine Company took over all the Galleon trade between the Americas and Asia from the 17th century until it went bankrupt in 1810.\n\nThis thesis aims to present the activities of the Spanish in East Asian waters in a more macroscopic and multi-angle way and answer the policy changes of the Spanish Bourbon dynasty in managing Manila, and why the trading company was established in the late 18th century. These are the main issues to be discussed in this thesis.\n\nThe answer to the question is:\n\nWhat was the main reason for the establishment of the Royal Philippine Company in 1785? \n\nAnswer: The main reason for the establishment of the Royal Philippine Company was to promote economic development and export trade in the Philippines. \n\nNote: The question is based on the last paragraph of the document, which states the purpose of the thesis.

How did their family roles change as a result of starting a business?  How did their experiences as entrepreneurs impact their lives and their roles in their families? \n\nThe correct answer is: \nTheir main reason for choosing to start a business was to prove themselves to their in-laws. They wanted to show that they could be independent and not rely on their husbands. They faced challenges such as insufficient funds, intense market competition, and difficulties in managing employees. Their family roles changed as they became the main breadwinners and also took on caregiving responsibilities. This change in family roles had a positive impact on their lives and their families.  They were no longer reliant on their husbands and were able to take on more responsibility in their families.", "answer_id": "2164"}

Although the Northern Yuan dynasty was destroyed in 1388, the Mongols still occupied the northern regions of the Ming dynasty, and thus became a major threat to the Ming dynasty for the next 276 years. In the early years of the Ming dynasty, the emperor established the nine gate system and the system of fortifying key defensive positions. However, during the Yongle era of the Ming dynasty, the emperor replaced the nine gate system with the system of border garrisons and abandoned most of the fortifications outside the Great Wall. This system was designed to allow the border garrisons to defend against the Mongols and the Beijing garrison to attack the Mongols. This system was in place until the Tumu incident of 1449, when the Beijing garrison was defeated and most of its soldiers were killed. The emperor then ordered the strengthening of the border garrisons to defend against the Mongols. Although the emperor strengthened the border defenses during the Chenghua and Hongzhi eras, the defenses of the Datong garrison remained inadequate and the system of border garrisons was in decline. During the Jiajing era, the system of providing food and supplies to the border garrisons failed, and the relationship between the border officials and soldiers deteriorated due to corruption and extortion. The Datong garrison was frequently attacked by the Mongols. In 1522, the Datong garrison was garrisoned by soldiers who were dissatisfied with their living conditions and pay. The soldiers rose up in a rebellion, known as the Five Fort Rebellion, and killed the governor, Zhang Wenjin. The emperor initially sympathized with the rebels and granted them amnesty, but the rebellion was not resolved. In 1524, the emperor ordered the strengthening of the defenses of the Datong garrison, but the governor, Hu Gan, was corrupt and the soldiers were dissatisfied with his leadership. The soldiers rose up again in a rebellion, and the emperor was forced to send a military commander to put down the rebellion.

{"question": "\n\n\nTranslation:\nKarl Friedrich Schinkel (1781-1841) was a renowned architect hired by King Frederick William III of Prussia (1770-1840, in power from 1797-1840) in the early 19th century. He held the positions of Geheimer Oberbaurat and public servant, responsible for designing city buildings in Prussia. After the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815), King Frederick William III realized that urban renovation and construction could not only show the power of the ruler but also promote urban prosperity and social progress. Under the guidance of architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel, large-scale construction projects in Berlin, including the \"New Watchtower\" (Neue Wache), \"Berlin Theatre\" (Schauspielhaus), \"Old Museum\" (Altes Museum), \"King's Bridge\" (Schlo\u00dfbr\u00fccke), and \"Berlin Building Academy\" (Berliner Bauakademie), were completed, and the long-held desire of the Prussian kings to build \"Athens on the Spree\" (Spree-Athen) in Berlin began to take shape.\n\nAcademics began to pay attention to Karl Friedrich Schinkel's urban design in Berlin in the mid-19th century. The main focus of the discussion was on (1) architectural style and design, (2) the impact of his personal experiences on the architectural style of Berlin. However, after reviewing the data and images, I found that Schinkel not only designed buildings that met the needs of modern Berlin, but also considered the problems of urban planning and traffic in Berlin. Under the limited budget, he integrated limited resources to renew the urban environment of Berlin and attempted to improve the uneven development of Berlin, making the old and new city areas more orderly. Therefore, Schinkel's urban construction of Berlin had a significant impact on the modernization of Berlin.\n\nBased on the above reasons, this article will not only introduce Schinkel's construction process in Berlin but also discuss Schinkel's contribution to environmental planning in Berlin, and then discuss the uniqueness of Berlin in the 19th century and the process of Berlin becoming a \"Cultural Capital\" (Kunsthauptstadt).\n\nThe question that can be answered by the document is:\n\nWhat was the main focus of discussion among academics when they first started to pay attention to Karl Friedrich Schinkel's urban design in Berlin in the mid-19th century? \n\nA) The impact of Schinkel's personal experiences on the architectural style of Berlin\nB) The", "answer_id": "1101"}

According to the statistics of different modern researchers, there were approximately 100 to 500 types of notes in the Song Dynasty. As a genre that has not been completely defined or has a vague definition, the content of notes usually involves various random observations, scattered and disorganized anecdotes, and informal conversations in non-formal settings. With the development of cultural history and publishing history research in recent decades, some Song Dynasty researchers have noticed that notes played an important role in the cultural and publishing culture of scholars in the Song Dynasty, and have also produced a series of related research. However, it seems that few researchers have been concerned with the issue of \"how a note was produced in the Song Dynasty?\" This gap is the object that this research tries to fill. By analyzing the place (Place) [where the production of notes occurred], the process (Procedure) [how the notes were compiled], and the product (Product) [the form of the notes as a product], this research tries to explore and establish the compilation mode of Song Dynasty notes. The three analysis directions - place, procedure, and product - actually derive from a theory by French scholar Michel de Certeau (1925-1986) that was first applied to analyze the cultural production activities in modern daily life. This thesis attempts to apply Michel de Certeau's theory to the case studies of three notes: \"Dongzhai Records\", \"Chuanshui Yan Tang Lu\", and \"Lupu Notes\". This research tries to explain how these Song Dynasty note authors, who had different social statuses, were in different institutions, held different positions, and belonged to different master-disciple groups, produced their own note works. In Chapter 1, it is attempted to point out that the author of \"Dongzhai Records\", Fan Zhen (1007-1088, Jingren), had working experience in the imperial archives, which not only strengthened the legitimacy of compiling notes, but also affected the form and content", "answer_id": "1413"}

{"question": "\n\n\nTranslation:\nIn the absence of female self-creation, \"Epitaph\" is often used as a research material for studying women in the Song Dynasty. The recorded life events of the deceased in the epitaph often convey the female image that the Song people value and are connected to the concept of \"Benevolence and righteousness\". When facing the fact that \"women have no external affairs\", some epitaph writers may need to write more about the life events of women to achieve the purpose of promoting the epitaph. As a result, some epitaph writers may consider writing about the deceased's reading of Buddhist scriptures. However, when a woman's life is connected to the epitaph's praise of benevolence and righteousness, what role can \"reading Buddhist scriptures\" play to form a connection between reading Buddhist scriptures, female roles, and the concept of benevolence and righteousness? The key to finding the answer lies in clarifying the understanding and cognition of epitaph writers and the deceased's family members about women reading Buddhist scriptures. Through the collection of this type of female epitaph, this study will observe from the following directions: First, the writing of these women's Buddhist scripture reading presents which features or tendencies, and discuss how the epitaph group places women's Buddhist scripture reading in their thinking; second, observe where these women's Buddhist scripture reading appear in the context of epitaph writing, especially which events are more likely to be written after; third, discuss how epitaph writers interpret this when Buddhist scripture reading is written into female epitaphs, thereby constructing a connection between the three; fourth, analyze the content of these women's Buddhist scripture reading, and understand the functions that the Song people recognize that reading Buddhist scriptures has, and understand why some epitaph writers want to present it in female epitaphs; finally, discuss the meaning of this connection and its breakthrough in our current understanding of Song women.\n\nThe question that can be answered by the document is:\n\nWhat role can \"reading Buddhist scriptures\" play in forming a connection between reading Buddhist scriptures, female roles, and the concept of benevolence and righteousness in Song Dynasty epitaphs? \u95dc\u65bc\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u662f\uff1a\u7576\u5b8b\u4ee3\u5973\u6027\u7684\u4e00\u751f\u5728\u88ab\u9023\u7d50\u6210\u5230\u8207\u4fee\u8eab\u9f4a\u5bb6\u6709\u95dc\u7684\u5893\u8a8c\u8b9a\u63da\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u300c\u8aa6\u8b80\u4f5b\u66f8\u300d\u80fd\u626e\u6f14\u626e\u6f14\u4e00\u500b\u5c0d\u5973\u6027\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u58eb\u4eba\u4fee\u8eab\u9f4a\u5bb6\u7684\u7406\u5ff5\u9032\u884c\u89e3\u91cb\u548c\u8a6e\u91cb\u7684\u89d2\u8272", "answer_id": "1270"}

{"question": "\nSummary:\nFor resource-poor Taiwan, the government's top priority is to ensure a stable energy supply. This thesis will examine the government's different management approaches to coal mining and oil refining, and their impact on Taiwan's energy industry.\nTaiwan's primary source of self-produced energy has always been coal, but Taiwan's coal is limited by geological conditions, resulting in poor quality and quantity. During the post-war economic development, thermal power generation became the main form of electricity generation, making Taipower the largest consumer of primary energy in Taiwan. Due to coal's inability to meet Taipower's fuel needs, imported oil became the primary source of energy. During this transition, the government used the two state-owned enterprises, CPC and Taipower, to shape Taiwan's energy structure. This thesis also discusses the relationship between the petrochemical industry and energy supply. CPC not only meets Taipower's fuel needs but also refines light oil to serve as a basic raw material for the development of the petrochemical industry.\nIn conclusion, this thesis believes that the government's control over primary energy supply after the war was motivated by a desire for national security and a desire to lead the development of Taiwan's industrialization. Therefore, giving up on coal's poor quality and limited quantity, and operating the oil industry through state-owned enterprises, not only ensures that Taipower can supply enough power for industrialization, but also assists the development of the private petrochemical industry, promoting economic development.\nKeywords: coal, oil, energy, coal mining, oil refining, petrochemical industry, energy industry, Taipower, CPC\n\nQuestion:\nWhat was the main reason for the government's control over primary energy supply after the war in Taiwan? |\n\nNote: The question is a summary of the main argument presented in the document, which is a key aspect of the topic. The question requires the reader to understand the main idea of the document and to identify the key factor that motivated the government's actions. \n\nAnswer:\nThe main reason for the government's control over primary energy supply after the war in Taiwan was a desire for national security and a desire to lead the development of Taiwan's industrialization. |\n\nThis question requires the reader to understand the main argument of the document, which is that the government's control over primary energy supply was motivated by a desire for national security and a desire to lead the development of Taiwan's industrialization.

{"question": "Translation:\nIn the past, discussions on the Great East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere were mainly focused on political or economic aspects, and it was considered to be a Japanese colonial propaganda. However, it was this propaganda that made Li Xianglan successful. In this propaganda, Li Xianglan was portrayed as the main medium to contact the Chinese, Japanese, and Taiwanese regions. This paper will explore how Li Xianglan became a star in the midst of the various policies and assistance during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945). The paper will be divided into three chapters: Chapter 1 will discuss Li Xianglan's rise to fame and its relationship with the Manchurian Film Corporation (Mangyoku). Mangyoku was established with a high political purpose, aiming to promote Japan's ideals of a harmonious and prosperous society through national policy films. Li Xianglan became a star under this ideology. This chapter will focus on Li Xianglan's debut, how Mangyoku shaped her image as a Chinese girl, and how she was promoted through films, goodwill activities, and other means to increase her exposure and popularity. Chapter 2 will explore Li Xianglan's activities in Taiwan and her related film work. This chapter will attempt to reconstruct the details of Li Xianglan's activities and performances in Taiwan and the filming of the patriotic film \"Shayun's Bell\" under the demand of the war slogan. This will further understand how Li Xianglan was gradually pushed into the spotlight to become one of the most popular artists in Taiwan. Chapter 3 will analyze the 1943 joint film \"Wan Shih Li Fang\" through Li Xianglan's performance in it, which was promoted by the Japanese side. This chapter will explore the significance of Li Xianglan's performance, how the Shanghai people evaluated and praised her, and how Li Xianglan changed her attitude and mood in response to the end of the war and the subsequent criticism of the film industry.\n\nWhat question can be generated from this document?\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\n1. How did the propaganda of the Great East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere contribute to Li Xianglan's success?\n2.

However, since the 1950s, the river has caused massive damage to the lives and property of the people of Taipei due to frequent floods caused by typhoons. Therefore, the rectification of the Keelung River watershed has become an urgent task for Taipei City. The Keelung River has undergone two canalization projects, the first of which was the canalization of the river in the Shilin District, resulting in the development of a large area of land for education, recreation, and leisure. The second project included a wider area and completely solved the flooding problem in Taipei. This paper focuses on the research of the Shilin segment after the first canalization project, and explores the utilization of the new land.\n\nThis study uses geographic information and technology, literature analysis, and field research to investigate the land use of the old riverbed in different periods, from the riverbed, artificial lake, to new land, and finally to the current orderly development zone. The study analyzes and discusses the land use changes and processes in the research area.\n\nThe study takes the area surrounded by Keelung River Road, Zhongzheng Road, Shisanhang Road, and Chengde Road as an example. In 1973, the water body accounted for most of the area, and the canalization project had been completed, but there was no clear plan for the use of the old riverbed. In 1980, the abandoned riverbed was rectified and planned, and a large area of land was added to the research area through land leveling. In 1991, the land use was mainly for public recreation. In 2002, it was mainly for public services related to people's livelihood. In 2012, the number of residents in the area increased, and a post office was set up to provide postal services. By 2020, the children's playground had been built in the area, and was combined with the National Taiwan Science Education Center, providing science education and leisure activities for the public. The dynamic presentation of land use changes shows the reuse and reclamation of land, bringing changes to the research area.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the main focus of the research study described in the document?

In the past, scholars and literati have used poetry to record their observations and experiences, including the natural scenery, human geography, people's livelihoods, and even resistance to foreign invasion. There are many poems created, making them a rich resource. In the traditional concept of \"wen shi yi jia\" (literature and history are one family), poetry is considered a valuable historical material that can complement the gaps in historical records, providing a more complete picture of history. Based on this understanding, the purpose of this text is to use poetry to discuss history and verify history. This text selects topics that are distinctive and can connect with modern national consciousness. First, it is necessary to study the indigenous peoples of Taiwan, who are the most distinctive and unique element of Taiwan's history and culture. Taiwan's history and culture were enriched by the indigenous peoples, making them the primary research topic of this text. Second, the Qing dynasty ruled Taiwan for 212 years, and during this period, the emperor, officials, and citizens all expressed their views on Taiwan's relationship with China. These views are considered important for modern Taiwanese citizens to understand, as they can serve as a reference for discussing Taiwan's future development. Therefore, this text also examines the Qing dynasty's views on Taiwan's sovereignty. In addition, the text also explores the impact of the Pacific War on Taiwan's fate, which is a topic that modern Taiwanese citizens must understand. The three research topics mentioned above are the core of this text, and the chapter titles are: \"Indigenous Peoples in Traditional Chinese Poetry\", \"Taiwan's Sovereignty in Traditional Poetry and Literature\", and \"Taiwan: Poetry and War (1937-1945)\". The first chapter focuses on the indigenous peoples' nature, \"gu yi\" (ancient spirit), and explores their social and cultural changes under the influence of external forces and immigration. The second chapter examines the views on Taiwan's sovereignty in traditional poetry and literature, collecting and analyzing 115 related texts from 84 authors, who are divided into three categories: emperors, officials, and scholars. The chapter begins with the views of the emperors of the Kang, Yong, and Qian dyn", "answer_id": "1817"}
