Walter Ullmann (1910-1983), an Austro-British and a well-known medieval historian, was expert in Medieval ecclesiastical history, legal history and history of political thought.
Prof. Ullmann has argued that “Descending and Ascending Thesis” was the most significant progress in the development of political thought in medieval Europe. By which, he meant that there were a crossover of two thoughts about the sovereignty of ruling. Namely, the descending theory has argued that ruling power of secular ruler derived from “the above,” descending from God, and modeled by and transmitted through Pope to Kings; while the ascending argument was secular rulers who got his power from “the bottom,” the people. Prof. Ullmann claimed the developments of “Descending and Ascending Thesis” were the mainstream of Medieval Europe. Accordingly, he used it in his studies to explain the historical aspects of medieval European society.
Above all, by his decent researches of “Descending and Ascending Thesis”, Prof. Ullmann has proclaimed the idea that we must study, and examine the manifestation of medieval European societies, before we can realize our modern world.
