This research aims to discuss the features of recipe contexts during the Japanese colonial period in Taiwan and the political and cultural meanings behind the words. Taiwan in Qing Dynasty remains in an immigrant society and the development of delicate food culture is not prosperous, and thus the number of dietary documents are rare. Except for a few local records, most recipes are documented by tourists in their travel anecdotes.
In the Japanese Colonial Period, Japanese recipes were frequently published in newspapers and magazines. Therefore, Taiwanese recipes skipped off the process of developing localized characteristics but directly inherited from the modern recipes that were influenced by the Western countries after the Meiji Restoration. This research, according to the Japanese colonial period, divides the development of Taiwanese recipes into three stages: Launch Stage (1900-1907), Stability Stage (1907-1936), and Wartime Stage (1937-1942).
During the launch stage, there was no recipe with modern elements, but the Japanese seasonal culture appeared during this period. In the stability stage, recipes introduce various kinds of cuisine including Taiwanese cuisine, Japanese cuisine, and lots of home cooking. The modern elements, such as accurate timing and measurement, were introduced in recipes. In Wartime Stage, recipes mainly apply the substitute food and the rice saving food and emphasize the nationality. Besides, at the end of World War II, no publication of recipes had been seen after 1942. The characteristics of recipes in different stages imply the relation with the vicissitude of society.
If we compare the occurrence of historical events (such as the Kominka Movement, and the Total Defense Mobilization... etc.), we can reveal the cultural and political implications behind the recipes.
