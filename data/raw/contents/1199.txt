After Southern Taiwan experienced many conflicts including armed fighting and peasant revolts in the late 18th century, local societies ended up with problems involving the worshipping of “wandering spirits”, also known as “vengeful” spirits that had to be addressed. Thus Minhsiung, an important transportation point in Southern Taiwan, expanded worshipping of tāi-sū-iâ(大士爺) that only takes place during the general salvation ceremony. It became the famous tāi-sū-iâ of Minhsiung. Since then, because tsú-gû-tshù(水牛厝) , a village of Chiayi County’s Taibao City shares common historical background with Minhsiung, they have been incorporated into the ritual context of Minhsiung’s tāi-sū-iâ as a result. Minhsiung tāi-sū-iâ later shared its power which got brought to tsú-gû-tshù and became the tāi-sū-iâ of tsú-gû-tshù. What’s noteworthy is that being a community with earlier development history, tsú-gû-tshù’s development of folk beliefs yielded no village temples but would instead worship tāi-sū-iâ as its most important annual ceremony. However, after about 200 years, under political intervention tāi-sū-iâ finally had its own temple built. Construction was completed in 2013 and the temple is named gio̍k-hông-kiong(玉皇宮). The paper wishes to discuss local politics and social changes from Japanese colonial era to postwar period as well as the effects brought forth by the temple’s construction. These can be used to explain the effects of local politics upon traditional folk beliefs. We may also observe the changes experienced by the settlement of tsú-gû-tshù and tāi-sū-iâ of tsú-gû-tshù over the past hundreds of years. We can also discover the interaction effects between social changes, local politics and folk beliefs as well as its outcome after hundreds of years.
