Banqiao is known for its rich and complete archives which represent compete and engage fact among four ethnic groups during that time: Zhang Zhou, Quan Zhou, Hakka and Plains aborigine. Based on the archives from temples, societies and cannels, the research shows:
First, the reason why Banqiao is dominated by Zhang Zhou is because Lin Chengzu gained the support by Peijtsil to dig the Da`anzhen. Therefore, more and more Zhang Zhou people came to Banqiao for their living. Second, Peijtsil and Pinorowan, two big Plains aborigines in Banqiao, were eventually Chinese localized. And almost nothing left except in local temples. Third, then Lin Chengzu family was replaced by Lin Benyuan family, showing the development of Banqiao was transfer from agriculture to business. Forth, regardless of Lin Chengzu family or Lin Benyuan family, they all made sure their leading roles by using religious groups.
The reason why this research pays attention to Lin Chengzu family and Lin Benyuan family is because Banqiao area was deeply influenced by these two families.
