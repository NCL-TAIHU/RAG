Abstract
In the first decade of colonialization, Japan had ruled the colonies with repression. After the March First Movement, at the start of 1920s, the first civilian governor general was appointed to Taiwan and a new colonial policy “cultural rule” (bunka seiji) was applied to Korea, which caused a cultural renaissance in 1920s. Westernized intellectual elites like Tasi Pei-huo and Yi Kwangsu, finished their studying in Japan and came back to Taiwan and Korea in 1921. They both admired Western civilization and hoped enthusiastically for the modernization of Taiwan and Korea.
This article sets forth and compares Tsai and Yi’s assertions of world view, self-knowledge and the way of “transforming” (kaizo) the societies. In this way, we can understand more about their thinking in 1920s of the relations between the colonizer and the colonized. Tsai and Yi collaborated with the Japanese authorities in modernization but also criticized its assimilation policy. Instead of launching anti-Japanese movements, they preferred focusing on lifting the societies’ cultures into modern level, joining the world trend of “keizo”. Tsai and Yi believed that the way for the colonies to survive in the modern world was to “transform” or modernize its cultures and ways of thinking, once the “transformation” finished, people in Taiwan and Korea could change the subordinated status and contribute to the world peace.
