Birth, ageing, illness and death are parts of our life. Interpretation of these phases differs from culture to culture. This thesis focuses on the endemic diseases of Southern China in medieval age, from the perspective of history of diseases and history of society and culture, discussing the concept formation of disease and the interaction with societies.
Apart from introduction and conclusion, we have 5 chapters in this thesis. The Chinese Medieval Ages are composed of Wei Jin Southern and Northern period and Tang dynasty, therefore, this thesis starts from the concept of geographical location, discussing the formation of idea of “South”.
In Wei Jin Southern and Northern period, with the “South” idea developing, the concept of Southern endemic diseases shaped gradually. Form the interactions between the North and the south, the imagination did not change due to the growing immigrant number to the South and the written records by Southern aristocracy, still continuing the traditional geographic discourse of the South.
In Sui and Tang dynasty, the North and the South untied. However, the ruling class from the North knew little about the newly conquered South and the rebellions by non-Han tribes happened occasionally. Therefore, the South had become a “savage land”. To fortify the danger and mystery of the non-Sino areas, the so-call endemic diseases became the main symbol of disease from these areas.
For above reasons, the South became a special area in the empire and the political arrangement, military activity and civil service adjusted accordingly in the South. For intellects, the South was also a crisis-hidden area, with various fatal virus in the air. The image didn’t change with the development of the South. Instead, the image was further strengthened and turned to be the outcome of collective consciousness of society.
