This preliminary research studies the company-led printing industry through various
“printing products” such as cigarette packaging materials, wine labels and books during the period of Japanese colonial rule over Taiwan. The author aims to explore factors that contributed to boost the development of the introduced Japanese printing manufacture, including support offered by the colonial government.
The study indicates that the development of printing industry showed cluster effect and a market-approaching characteristic. The center of the printing industry was shifted from Tainan to Taipei along with the change of rulership.The author examined three cases of Taipei-based Japanese invested companies to represent the patterns of new printing technology and raw material industry chain.
The products of these printing companies included cigarette packs and wine labels, which were related to tobacco and alcohol monopolies, together with official statistics, textbooks and others. Most printing products related with colonial government to promote the achievement of its rule, and to pursue its policies, which became more noticeable over the period of war.
