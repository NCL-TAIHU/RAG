People had always been using their own methods to pass down and record history in different eras until the contemporary era with clear division between academic disciplines that not only divided history into the “academic” and the “public” imperceptibly, but also made written language the primary method of recording history. However, other media such as image and sound that are equally effective and possess historical and traditional narrative methods are seldom seen in academic sector. Nevertheless, media that introduce the public to history are relatively diverse comparing to academic’ unitary method of recording history. History discipline should dare to experience different media for a more open line of communication between them.
This kind of thinking supported me to carry out “historical music creation”. Following the long tradition of telling history by music with its ease of dissemination and emotion-bearing characteristics, I conducted artistic music creation with rigorous academic research methods of history in the hope to bridge its gap between the academic and the public. Doing so not only can promote history more effectively, but also provide another effective historical writing method apart from written language for future researchers.
The thesis has two main presentations. One of them was the historical music concert “Do You Hear the History Sing?” held in the National Taiwan Normal University’s auditorium this year (2018). The other one is the hard copy thesis “Perhaps One Day – Writing Taiwanese History with Music”. This paper discusses “historical music creation”, explains the reasons for a different path to history, as well as the author’s methods and content of music creation and psychological journey.
